# WhatsApp
Create a Flask backend API for Whatsapp
The Whatsapp API should contain the following views:
1. GET messages between user1 and user 2
2. POST a message from user1 to user2
3. PATCH Edit the previous message from the user.
4. Start chatting with a new user


Note: you do NOT need to implement user authentication
Hint: You can create one txt / csv file for a chat between 2 users eg. for a
chat between Lisa and Tim, use a file name called lisa_tim_chat.txt
